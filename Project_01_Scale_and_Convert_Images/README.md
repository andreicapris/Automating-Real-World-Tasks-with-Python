Problem Statement:
It turns out that your company is in the process of updating its website, and a design contractor has been hired to create some new icon graphics for the site. However, the contractor has delivered the final designs and they’re in the wrong format, rotated 90° and too large. You’re unable to get in contact with the designers and your own deadline is approaching fast. You’ll need to use Python to get these images ready for launch!

Sample Images folder should contain the images that we want to rotate with 90 degrees. 
The script setup.py is written in case you would want to use other sample images and improperly rotate them. 
Running setup.py once will rotate the images clockwise 90 degrees.
