Problem Statement:

In the next lab, you'll have to process information related to the sales your company generated last month, and turn that into a nicely formatted PDF report that you'll then send by email so that your boss can look at it. The lab machine has email configured so that you can check your resulting emails through a nice webmail interface that's already up and running.
