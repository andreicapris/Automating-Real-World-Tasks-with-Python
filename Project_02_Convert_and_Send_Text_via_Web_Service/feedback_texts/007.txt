Called them to look for a second-hand RAV4 and they are very nice and patience to help mefind a few matches then scheduled an appointment with me. Came in and they had everything ready for me. I was surprised how proffesional those sales are and they explained everything and answered all my questions. Ended up buying the car and been using it for more than a month now. Everything looks good!
